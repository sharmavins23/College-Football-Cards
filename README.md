# College Football Cards

This is a small website project designed to practice website development in
React.

## Overview

The project scrapes information from the
[College Football Data API](https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json).
A user selects a college football conference from a dropdown, and the choice
goes towards forming a request to the application API. The resulting teams
information is parsed into components which are displayed as cards in the area
underneath the request box.
